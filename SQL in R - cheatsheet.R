# Some tips and examples of SQL in R using SMRA views, which can be applied to other databases
# 
# Why would you want to use SQL?:
#   Faster - you extract the data you need quicker and further analysis will
#            be more efficient as well
#   Easy - the syntax of SQL is similar to how we construct phrases.
#   Transportable - can be used within Python, SPSS, R, on its own...
#   Good for R - R can run in to memory issues if your data sets are too large.
#                With SQL you reduce the size of your objects.
# 
# SQL always needs two parameters: SELECT (what fields you want) and 
# FROM (what table you want).
# WHERE is a command very oftenly used, it is used to add any condition 
# (e.g. time period, age, diagnosis).
# There are other many other commands such like JOIN (for linking tables), 
# GROUP BY (to aggregate) and ORDER BY (to sort cases).
# 
# With SQL, Internet is your friend, search for an answer and you shall find it.
# This is an useful web to learn SQL: http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp
# And this a good summary of using SQL in SMRA (from where some of this info comes from):
# https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/R-Resources/blob/master/using%20SMRA%20with%20R.md
# 
# Common problems/errors while writing SQL code in R:
#   Problems with simple and double quotation marks. 
#   Commas before FROM, or lack of commas between fields.
#   No grouping by expressions or missing some, if you use any command to aggregate
#   the data you will need a group by

# Use the table of contents to get to the right bit of information

# This script cover examples using native SQL within R, but another approach
# is to use the package dbplyr which translates R code (based on dplyr) into SQL.

## Let's start ----
###############################################.
# You will need access to SMR01 and the deaths catalogue
# To connect to a database first you need the package odbc
library(odbc)
library(dplyr) # and dplyr for a couple of things

# And now connect to the database with your login details
channel <- suppressWarnings(dbConnect(odbc(),  dsn="SMRA",
                                      uid=.rs.askForPassword("SMRA Username:"), 
                                      pwd=.rs.askForPassword("SMRA Password:")))

# Show all tables/views available 
dbListTables(channel)
# Look at the table 'scheme' types that are available by running the code below
odbcListObjects(channel)  
# "Analysis" schemes are the analysis views, likely the ones you want to use. 
# Tables with a 'scheme' which is a username are data uploaded by individual users. 
# Show tables/views again, but this time restrict to "Analysis" views only.
odbcListObjects(channel, schema="ANALYSIS")
# You can now see the names of the analysis views, these are the same names/data 
# Most of the views are versions of the various SMR databases: 
# SMR00 (outpatients), SMR01 (Acute hospital activity), SMR04 etc.
# The "_PI" suffix means that these views contain personally identifying 
# information (names, dates of birth etc). SMRXX_PI is the usual version used 
# for analyses. SMRA also includes NRS death records (GRO_DEATHS_C). 
# Other files are reference files which contain information about coded fields
# e.g. if you have a list of codes referring to hospitals and you want to know 
# the hospital names or postcodes, you would use the LOCATION view to look up 
# this information.
# 
# In order to view the variables, we can preview the table. 
# Further details of variable names and attributes in each of the SMR views 
# can also be found in the view layout files.

###############################################.
# This is done through the regexp_like expression. This looks for the text that 
# you want in the field, in a particular position or in any.
# Regular expressions are very powerful and for example can be adjusted to look

# The command GROUP BY needs to be used together with these functions.

## 23 - Create tables  ----
###############################################.
# Similarly as with the command WITH you can create temporary tables that then
# you can use in other queries
# In this example we will create a table with information on a set of patients
# that will be used to extract more information about these patients.

# First we create the dataframe with the list of patients we are interested in.
# Variable names must be in ALL CAPITALS to be used in an SQL query later.
# Tables with non-capitalised variable names will upload, but you will not be 
# able to use the non-capitalised names in an SQL query.

                                    01959200, 11949200, 02939132, 00000383),
                        INCOHORT = rep("yes", 9))

# Upload to SMRA using the dbWriteTable function
dbWriteTable(channel, "test", test_data)

# The table will be uploaded to a schema that is your username. 
# To see a list of tables that you have uploaded run:
dbListTables(channel, schema="USERNAME")
# Replacing with the username you use to access SMRA, in all capitals.

# The table name must be enclosed in double quotes, this only applies to your 
# uploaded tables, NOT to SMRA tables/views generally. The query statement as a 
# whole must therefore be enclosed in single quotes when using a temporary table.
# Example:
# This syntax works:
sql_example23_1 <- dbGetQuery(channel, statement='SELECT * FROM USERNAME."test" ') 
# This syntax, with the double and single quote positions inverted, will result in an error.
sql_example23_1 <- dbGetQuery(channel, statement="SELECT * FROM 'USERNAME.test'")

# You can now use the uploaded table in another query . We will use the table to 
# retrieve information from SMRA using a JOIN command.

  'SELECT t2.link_no, t2.cis_marker, t2.location, t2.admission_date,

# Delete the table once you have finished using it using dbRemoveTable
dbRemoveTable(channel, "test")
# To check it has been removed:
dbListTables(channel, schema="USERNAME")

# It is of course possible to extract information based on a personal table
# containing other fields in addition to LINK_NO to further refine the selection, 
# perhaps years of interest in combination with LINK_NO.

# Uploading dates from R to SMRA is a little complicated, you will need to do some
# formatting in SQL. Before uploading, you first need to convert the dates in the 
# cohort file to a numeric field in CCYYMMDD format. You will then nee to alter 
# the type of the SMR dates to the same numeric format during the extraction.

# The example below extracts SMR01 data in the year to infection. 
# The uploaded file contains a list of patient UPIs and two dates, indicating a 
# sample date and a date one year before the sample, and these dates are used 
# to limit the data extracted.
